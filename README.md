# Tasks

## Task 1: Horizontal Sliding Component

1. Clone an existing repository of React and create a horizontal sliding component with the following specifications:
   - The slider should display three cards at a time on a laptop and only one card at a time on mobile phones.
   - Use CSS Grid.
   - Make the UI as interactive as you can by CSS animations, text etc and showcase your technical skills in each card.
   
2. Create a page of your own in a folder with your name in `src/pages`, which includes the JavaScript and CSS files. Add a route in `app.js` to link your page to `app.js`.

## Task 2: Quiz Application

1. Use an API of your choice and create a simple quiz application with the following requirements:
   - The application should be responsive.
   - The user should be able to attend the quiz with only one question displayed at a time, along with the current score.
   - Make the UI as close as possible to this design: [Audible Utility Quiz](https://dribbble.com/shots/17815087-Audible-Utility-Quiz).
   - The quiz should end after 10 to 15 questions, displaying the score and providing an option to reattempt the quiz.
   
2. Upload your React application in the `task_2` folder without the `node_modules`.
